# Reference Implementation of Teradata Covalent UI Platform's - Landing Page Template
This repository is a reference implementation of Teradata Covalent UI Platform's **Landing Page Template** built with [Material](https://material.angular.io/) on [Angular](https://angular.io/).

The screenshot of the Landing Page template is listed at https://teradata.github.io/covalent/#/templates 

## Why i built this
There are very few examples of complete websites built with Material for Angular. While Teradata's Covalent is a great example but the pre-built templates they built do not have a downloadable, full-built Angular project for developers to use as starter / base packages. 

The stackblitz examples (links below) provided by Teradata provide good overview and working examples with code but do not have a downloadable, working sources. We have to manally copy the contents of the files.

## Technical details
* This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

### Primary dependencies 
* Angular Material `@angular/material 7.0.1`
* Covalent Core `@covalent/core ^2.0.0-rc.2`
* Please see `package.json` for all dependencies

## Build
After you clone the project, `cd` to the downloaded directory and run `npm install` to generate dependencies.

## Run
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The home page should load the "Landing Page" template as shown below.
